# Environments:

GW_KEY=stirng                           - "generated" to generate key, path to private key file, hex string or wif (default "generated")
GW_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=Duration             - timeout for request
GW_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=Duration             - timeout for connection
GW_LISTEN_ADDRESS=host:port             - address to listen connections
GW_PEERS_<X>_ADDRESS=host:port          - address of NeoFS Node
GW_PEERS_<X>_WEIGHT=float               - weight of NeoFS Node
GW_PPROF=bool                           - enable/disable pprof (/debug/pprof)
GW_METRICS=bool                         - enable/disable prometheus metrics endpoint (/metrics)
GW_KEEPALIVE_TIME=Duration              - Ð°fter a duration of this time if the client doesn't see any activity
it pings the server to see if the transport is still alive. 
GW_KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT=Duration           - after having pinged for keepalive check, the client waits for a duration
of Timeout and if no activity is seen even after that the connection is closed
GW_KEEPALIVE_PERMIT_WITHOUT_STREAM=Bool - if true, client sends keepalive pings even with no active RPCs.
If false, when there are no active RPCs, Time and Timeout will be ignored and no keepalive pings will be sent.
```

### WARNING
`generated` value for `GW_KEY` or `--key` is deprecated, you should use pre-generated keys.
