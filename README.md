# NeoFS HTTP Gate

NeoFS HTTP Gate is example of tool that provides basic interactions with NeoFS.

- you can download one file per request from NeoFS Network using NeoFS Gate
- you can upload one file per request into NeoFS Network using NeoFS Gate 

## Notable make targets

```
  Usage:

    make <target>

  Targets:

    deps      Check and ensure dependencies
    dev       Build development docker images
    help      Show this help prompt
    image     Build docker image
    publish   Publish docker image
    version   Show current version
```

## Install

```go get -u github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-http-gate```

## File uploading behaviors

- you can upload on file per request
- if `FileName` not provided by Header attributes, multipart/form filename will be used instead

# Environments:

HTTP_GW_KEY=string                           - "generated" to generate key, path to private key file, hex string or wif (default "generated")
HTTP_GW_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=Duration             - timeout for connection
HTTP_GW_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=Duration             - timeout for request
HTTP_GW_REBALANCE_TIMER=Duration             - time between connections checks
HTTP_GW_LISTEN_ADDRESS=host:port             - address to listen connections
HTTP_GW_PEERS_<X>_ADDRESS=host:port          - address of NeoFS Node
HTTP_GW_PEERS_<X>_WEIGHT=float               - weight of NeoFS Node
HTTP_GW_PPROF=bool                           - enable/disable pprof (/debug/pprof)
HTTP_GW_METRICS=bool                         - enable/disable prometheus metrics endpoint (/metrics)
HTTP_GW_LOGGER_FORMAT=string                 - logger format
HTTP_GW_LOGGER_LEVEL=string                  - logger level
HTTP_GW_LOGGER_NO_CALLER=bool                - logger don't show caller
HTTP_GW_LOGGER_NO_DISCLAIMER=bool            - logger don't show application name/version
HTTP_GW_LOGGER_SAMPLING_INITIAL=int          - logger sampling initial
HTTP_GW_LOGGER_SAMPLING_THEREAFTER=int       - logger sampling thereafter
HTTP_GW_LOGGER_TRACE_LEVEL=string            - logger show trace on level
HTTP_GW_KEEPALIVE_TIME=Duration              - Ð°fter a duration of this time if the client doesn't see any activity
it pings the server to see if the transport is still alive. 
HTTP_GW_KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT=Duration           - after having pinged for keepalive check, the client waits for a duration
of Timeout and if no activity is seen even after that the connection is closed
HTTP_GW_KEEPALIVE_PERMIT_WITHOUT_STREAM=Bool - if true, client sends keepalive pings even with no active RPCs.
If false, when there are no active RPCs, Time and Timeout will be ignored and no keepalive pings will be sent.

HTTP_GW_UPLOAD_HEADER_USE_DEFAULT_TIMESTAMP=bool - enable/disable adding current timestamp attribute when object uploads

Peers preset:

HTTP_GW_PEERS_[N]_ADDRESS = string
HTTP_GW_PEERS_[N]_WEIGHT = 0..1 (float)
